::: {#intro-heading}

My name is Delilah Acosta ([pronunciation](https://namedrop.io/delilahacosta)). The pronouns that I use are [she/her/hers](https://pronouns.org/she-her).

I am an undergraduate student at Macalester College pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Geological Sciences. My interests include igneous petrology, geochemistry and mineralogy.

I was born in El Paso, Texas. When I was 17, I matched to Macalester College though [Questbridge](https://www.questbridge.org/apply-to-college/programs/national-college-match) and earned a full ride scholarship. I love collecting CD's and reading! My favorite CD I own is I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love by My Chemical Romance. I am a fan of roller skating, ice skating, and hiking.
